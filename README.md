# Project 1: Global Warming – UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Module 7 & 8 - Project 1 Group Challenge

---------
## Background 

![greenhousegas](Images/greenhouse-gas-emissions-606x303.jpeg)

Global warming is unfortunately becoming more evident in recent years and is having a devastating impact on populations globally. We wanted to find out how much greenhouse gas emissions has been contributing to global warming in the UK. 

In order to analyze this, we looked specifically at the dataset for UK from 'https://climate-change.data.gov.uk/' data repository for the period of 1990-2020. 

First and foremost, two datasets were obtained from the database, one archived on the basis of source of the greenhouse gas emission and the other archived on the basis of end-users responsible for emission.

---------

The two datasets obtained from 'https://climate-change.data.gov.uk/' cleaned and unnessary columns were taken out before commencing the analysis.

## Major Sectors
First and formost we determined the major sectors that contributed towards the green gas emission for the UK (from 1990-2020). We compared the analysis between sources and end-users dataset.

![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Sectors%20responsible%20-endusers.png)

Unlike the popuplar opinion that transport is a major player, the results show that transport sector consitutes to only 10% of the total while 87% of the emission is contributed by the other 3 sectors which include Agriculture, Business, Energy and Land-related activities.

In order to dive deeper into the four major sectors, we grouped together the dataset based on the Agriculture, Business, Transport, Energy & Land related activities using loc function and looked at the activities that were performed within these sectors.

In order to identify whether there has been any changes to the activities of the top contributors, the entire dataset was grouped based on sectors and the trend in their activities for the entire duration of the dataset was anlaysed. 

A continual upwards trend contributing consistently to the greenhouse gases emission by agriculture, business and transport sector was noted. However, in case of the energy sector there has been slow but definite downward movement. UK government's has put forward plans to phase out of UK's coal plants within the next few years and this initiative should see further improvement in this sector.

A continual upwards trend contributing consistently to the greenhouse gases emission for agriculture, business, transport and land use -related sector was noted. 

---------
## When all the sectors are combined which activities contribute to most emission?
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Top10%20activities%20by%20users%20irrespective%20of%20sector.png)

Refrigeration & air conditioning, soil emission (direct and indirect), Industrial combustion, agriculture soil management, animal waste management and national navigation (shipping) contributes to most emmsion within the UK.

## What are the fuels which contribute to the total emission?
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Fueltype-souces.png)

Burning of the 'actual' fuel contributed to a third of the emission in the UK while the remaining 2/3 was contributed by - industrial combustion, agricultural soil management, refrigeration and air conditioning and industries (glass, chemical) activities

---------
Other Emissions included in the pie chart includes –
(a) 
Cattle, Horses, Pig and Poultry wastes
Soil emission (both direct and indirect),
Drainage of organic soils - settlements
Waste incineration,

(b)
Refrigeration and air conditioning,

(c)
Glass Production,
Gas flare,
Chemical Industries, 
Power stations, 
Industrial combustion, 
Manufacture of solid fuels and other energy industries

---------
## Major components of the emission -
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Amount%20of%20gh%20gases%20by%20endusers.png)

Greenhouse gases in our dataset agreed with and showed a similar composition of gases to the total emission noted before by other environment protection agencies such as USA. This included CO2 being on the top, followed by Methane, Nitrous oxide and Hydrofluorocarbons. 
1. Carbon dioxide (CO2)–
CO2 causes 80% of global warming and its release is mainly contributed by fossil fuels burning like coal, oil and gas or deforestation.
2. Methane (CH4)– 
Methane possess >80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide for the first 20 years after being released
3. Nitrous oxide (N2O) –
Increased N- based fertilizer use (>50 years) has been responsible for dramatic increase in its emission. 
4. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) –
HFCs are highly effective at trapping solar radiation (infrared radiation) and redirecting it toward Earth's surface. 
Major source of HFCs are refrigeration and air conditioning

---------
## 9. Top emitters of Carbon dioxide?
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Top%20emitters%20of%20Co2.png)

As expected, CO2 emission was mainly due to industrial combustion, solid fuel industries and power stations.

---------
## 10. Top emitters of Methane?
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Top%20emitters%20of%20Methane.png)

In case of Methane, the major emitters are industrial combustion, animal wastes management and power stations.

---------
## 11. Top emitters of Nitrous oxide?
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Top%20emitters%20of%20NO2.png)

The top emitters for Nitrous oxide include agricultural soil & waste management, and combustion

---------
## 12. Top emitters of Hydroflurocarbons?
![alt text](https://github.com/fbrowther/Project-1/blob/main/Analysis%20Images/Top%20emitters%20of%20HFC.png)

The sole and the most emitter of hydroflurocarbons include refrigeration and air conditioning

---------
## Conclusion on the overall trend seen with emissions in the UK

(1) With the help of this project we were able to identify the top most sectors that were contributing to around 90% of the emission. 
(2) Within these sector we were able to look deeper into what major activities that was responsible for the emission. 
(3) We also looked at the trend of the activities of the sectors to see if there has been any changes pertaining to more recent extreme weather conditions. 
(4) Since we noticed an upward trend in the activities of the top responsible sectors, we urge the policy makers to take more stringent measure to both curb and transform the practices of these sectors 
(5) finally we suggest we look into modalities that can be used to capture already released greenhouse gases, from the atmosphere and limit its damage.
